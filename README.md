# File Cleaner Redux

File Cleaner Redux is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) which helps in removing unused / empty markdown files and attachments based on a few user controlled options.

Out of the box, this plugin only looks for completely empty markdown files which are not referenced to by other files.

When performing the cleanup, the user will be presented with a summary of which files was found and the user can then choose to delete all, none or some of these files (See [#Preview of deleted files](#preview-of-deleted-files)).
