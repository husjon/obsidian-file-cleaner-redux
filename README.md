# File Cleaner Redux

File Cleaner Redux is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) which helps in removing unused / empty markdown files and attachments based on a few user controlled options.

Out of the box, this plugin only looks for completely empty markdown files which are not referenced to by other files.

When performing the cleanup, the user will be presented with a summary of which files was found and the user can then choose to delete all, none or some of these files (See [#Preview of deleted files](#preview-of-deleted-files)).

## Options

A [screenshot](#plugins-settings-showing-default-values) showing all the options can be found below.

### Folders

#### Remove folders (optional)

Can be toggled to allow for deletion of empty folders during the cleanup.

#### Excluded / Included Folders (Optional)

Toggles between using a list of excluded or included folders to look for files.
The same list is used for both exclusion/inclusion however they are mutually exclusive.  
If toggled off, the list is used for exclusion, meaning that the plugin will scan all folders **except** for the ones listed.  
If toggled on, the list is used for inclusion, meaning that the plugin will only scan the ones listed.

### Files

#### Excluded / Included Extensions (Optional)

Toggles between using a list of excluded or included extensions to look for.
The same list is used for both exclusion/inclusion however they are mutually exclusive.  
If toggled off, the list is used for exclusion, meaning that the plugin will ignore any attachments with extensions listed here.  
If toggled on, the list is used for inclusion, meaning that the plugin **will only** look for attachments with extensions listed here.
